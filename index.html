            <h1>William A. Baker</h1>
            <p>I’m a data analyst with a technical operations background and an interest in building systems that not only deliver insights but also improve how teams work and make decisions. Over the past three years, I’ve supported high-scale programs—most recently within Google/YouTube via Highspring—where I developed internal tools, dashboards, and data models that supported global operations and 24/7-coverage workflows.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Much of my recent work has involved maintaining and automating operational data pipelines, working across SQL, Python, JavaScript, and Google Apps Script to support performance tracking, quality assurance (HITL), and process governance. I’ve worked closely with cross-functional teams—engineering, QA, program management—to analyze data trends, interpret key metrics like turnaround time and utilization, and communicate findings clearly to both technical teams and business stakeholders.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What drives me is not just solving problems, but understanding systems—why a process is built the way it is, how data moves through it, and where it can be improved. I’m especially interested in roles where I can expand on this systems-level thinking while developing deeper skills in areas like backend data engineering, API integration, cloud architecture, and scalable automation. I enjoy writing clean, well-documented code, learning new tools, and collaborating with people who care about building things that are both functional and sustainable.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to my work in tech, I earned a Ph.D. in German Language and Literature. I spent nearly a decade in academia, teaching language, culture, and film at the university level. This experience taught me how to deconstruct abstract systems, breaking them down into digestible, human-centered models. It also shapes how I approach communication, training, and cross-cultural collaboration. I’ve worked in multilingual teams and remote environments, and I care deeply about clarity, documentation, and aligning technical work with real-world needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute immediately as an analyst or operations specialist, while continuing to grow into more technical roles. I’m especially drawn to environments where learning is part of the culture—where mentorship, experimentation, and constructive feedback are treated as essential, not optional.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy learning about foreign languages and cultures and applying that knowledge to read novels and philosophical works in their original languages. This practice helps me stay curious, think across perspectives, and remain connected to a global and historical context—skills I believe complement and enrich my approach to both data and collaboration.</p>
